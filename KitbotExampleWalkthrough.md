# Kitbot Code Tutorial

## Intro

### What is a kitbot?

The kitbot is a drivetrain which comes in the Kit of Parts provided by FIRST as part of registration.
It is a typical of example of a type of drivetrain known as a differential drive.
That name comes from the fact that the amount it turns is equal to the difference between the speed of the left and right sides.
This type of drive is also known as skid-steer or tank drive.

### Why kitbot?

We do not use the kitbot or other differential drive for our robots in competition.
Instead we use a much more versatile swerve drive.
However the code for a swerve drive is much more complex than a tank drive, which provides a good exercise to introduce you to programming FRC robots.
The kitbot has somewhat standard dimensions, gearboxes, wheels, and other physical characteristics so it makes for a consistent mechanism to start with.
