# Java

## “Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible” (Wikipedia)

The majority of our robot code is made in Java, and at least basic familiarity with the language is necessary to contribute to robot code. APCSA, FTC, or the following resources are all great starting points to learn java, and you should be able to pick up a lot of it by working with the robot code. If you already know another language you might be able to skip this step, but familiarizing yourself with the language is always valuable.

### Resources

- [Code Academy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-java) - online course
- [Head First Java](https://www.rcsdk12.org/cms/lib/NY01001156/Centricity/Domain/4951/Head_First_Java_Second_Edition.pdf) - book

### Exercises

- ***TODO!*** *Figure out some extra exercises for people to demonstrate proficiency*

### Notes

- We use an auto-formatter to keep the code clean. To run it type `./gradlew spotlessApply` into the terminal. This should be done before you push code (if not more frequently!) to keep the codebase readable.
