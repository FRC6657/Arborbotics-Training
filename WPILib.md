# WPILib

## WPILib is the standard library for FRC, providing code to interface with hardware, structure and run high-level code, and use advanced controls

WPILib is an open source project that aims to raise the floor of what FRC teams can do with software. The project has a little bit of everything in it and is the main building block that our code is built on top of. It also has pretty extensive documentation.

### Resources

- **[WPILib docs](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/index.html)**
- [WPILib zero to robot guide](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/zero-to-robot/introduction.html)
- [WPILib repo](https://github.com/wpilibsuite/allwpilib)
- [Installation guide](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/zero-to-robot/step-2/wpilib-setup.html)

### Examples

- After installing WPILib, go to the command list by clicking on the WPILib logo in the upper right corner, then pressing "create a new project" then "examples"
- Look at our old codebase!

### Exercises

- Download and install WPILib
- Create a basic set of kitbot drive code from the timed robot skeleton

### Notes

- See also the [Command-based](CommandBased.md) article for more information about how we architect our code using WPILib
- A lot of what WPILib does is "under the hood" to let us focus on high-level code rather than low-level hardware interface
