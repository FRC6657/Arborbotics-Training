# Kitbot Sim Tutorial

## Intro

Writing code is plenty of fun on its own, but its rough having to wait for mechanical to be done to test it.
When we only have 2-3 weeks of time (which we have to share with drive practice!) after the robot is built before our first competition, we need to be able to test before the robot is ready.
Luckily, we have a handy piece of code that to refactor to be simulateable!
In this tutorial we are going to rework your kitbot code to be easy to simulate and expand on.
In the end your code should be able to do this:

## Code Walkthrough

### Moving to AdvantageKit

The first step of moving our standard Command-based code to a loggable, simulateable structure is to install AdvantageKit.
Luckily AdvantageKit has a handy guide on how to install it on an existing code base.
Follow [this walkthrough](https://github.com/Mechanical-Advantage/AdvantageKit/blob/main/docs/INSTALLATION.md) until you finish the "Robot Configuration" step.
